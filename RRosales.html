                    Every time I tell somebody that I was born and raised in San Francisco, their response is "OH REALLY?!" I was always proud to be from here but I guess you can't find too many people originally from San Francisco, which it makes it an even greater honor to represent my city.

                    I've lived here all of my life. A lot has changed but at the same time, a lot has stayed the same. A tip for tourists or people who live here but haven't explored the city: San Francisco is beautiful, but just don't go to most of The Tenderloin, 6th St. in downtown, Bayview/Hunter's Point, and the Visitacion Valley. These are the places that have stayed the same. They're trying to change. Just spot them a few, maybe 15-20 more years.

                    If there was a rehab center for coffee addicts, I would attend the first day and never come back. I didn't like coffee initially. I survived on energy drinks through the first half of college until my heart started feeling weird and had a few instances where my heart stopped beating for a second. It wasn't until I met my girlfriend that I started drinking coffee. Now I can't live without it. Sometimes it's the first thing that's on my mind when I wake up. Sometimes I drink it to change my mood. You can say that's the curse part.

                    I am a diehard Golden State Warriors fan. I've been a fan since I can remember. I would say that the current state of the Warriors was worth the years of disappointment. During the NBA season is when you'll see me at my best and worst. My mood changes as the wins and losses pile up. Also, my production level takes a nose dive between the months of October and June (start of season to the NBA Finals).
